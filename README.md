# Machine-Learning-Predicting_House-Price

**Project Summary: Predicting House Prices on Kaggle**

**Project Team:** Aitana Hierro Garzon, Fariza Sagindykova, Aaron Huang

**Competition Link:** [Kaggle House Prices Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

---

**Overview:**

The Kaggle House Prices competition challenges participants to predict the final price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, based on 79 explanatory variables. The dataset provides a rich opportunity for exploring creative feature engineering and applying advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting.

**Description:**

The dataset, compiled by Dean De Cock, offers a comprehensive look at various aspects of residential homes. Participants are tasked with predicting the sales price of each house based on provided features.

**Evaluation:**

Participants' submissions are evaluated based on the Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. This evaluation metric ensures that errors in predicting both expensive and cheap houses equally affect the result.
